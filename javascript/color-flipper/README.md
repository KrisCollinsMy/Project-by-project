# Description

## In this project, I attempt to build a color flipper in plain javascript. The idea of the project is, when the user presses a button, the background changes to a different color each time. There will be 2 tab choices. The first tab, in which there will only be a fixed amount of colors and the second tab where it can be any hex color.

# Key Concepts Applied

1. Normalize.css
2. SASS, a CSS preprocessor
3. Importing fonts from Google Fonts
4. Rem vs em
5. CSS calc() Function
6. Javascript arrow functions, setting a named callback function to an event makes the code easier to read and understand.
7. Javascript code refactoring
8. Some examples of good variable names for a div element include:
   - headerContainer

9. Some examples of good variable names for a button element include:
