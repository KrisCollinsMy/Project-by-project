# Description

## In this project, I attempt to build a color flipper in plain javascript. The idea of the project is, when the user presses a button, the background changes to a different color each time. There will be 2 tab choices. The first tab, in which there will only be a fixed amount of colors and the second tab where it can be any hex color.
