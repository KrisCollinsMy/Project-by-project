# Description

## In this project, I attempt to build a color flipper in plain javascript. The idea of the project is, when the user presses a button, the background changes to a different color each time. In this first attempt, I will be creating the project to match the reference as seen here https://vannilla-js-basic-project-1-background-color.netlify.app/index.html without looking at the tutorial first.
